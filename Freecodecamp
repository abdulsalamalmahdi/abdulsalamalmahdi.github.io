15- Finding a Remainder in JavaScript:
```
var remainder = 11 % 3;
```
16- Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition:
```
var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
```
17- Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction:
```
var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only modify code below this line

a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
```
18- Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication:
```
var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;

// Only modify code below this line

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *=  10;
```
19- Compound Assignment With Augmented Division:
```
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only modify code below this line

a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
```
20- eclare String Variables:
```
// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line

var myFirstName = "Abdulsalam";
var myLastName  = "Almahdi";
```
21- Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings:
```
r myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line

```
22- Quoting Strings with Single Quotes:
```
var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

```
23- Escape Sequences in Strings:
```
var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"; 
```
24- Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator:
```
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
```
25- concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator:
```
var myStr =  "This is the first sentence. ";

myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
```
26- Constructing Strings with Variables:
```
var myName = "Abdulsalam";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + "and I am well!";
```
27-  Appending Variables to Strings:
```
var someAdjective = "learning to communicate with your mind";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
 
 myStr += someAdjective;
 ```
 28- Find the Length of a String:
 ```
 var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
```
29- use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String:
```
// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];

```
30- Understand String Immutability:
```
myStr = "Hello World"; // Fix Me
```
31- Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String:
```
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];

```
32- Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String:
```
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
```
33- Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String:
```
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];

```
34- Word Blanks:
```
function wordBlanks(myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, myAdverb) {
  // Your code below this line

  result+= "My "+myAdjective+" "+myNoun+" "+myVerb+" very "+myAdverb+".";


  // Your code above this line
  return result;
}
```
